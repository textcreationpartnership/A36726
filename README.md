b•speak them his enemies, being con•radictory to
His, which they profess with their month, but deny
in their works:

    _ 1. There will arise men witho•t a Chief, who shall
feed and grow far upon the sins of the people,

procure themselves applause from the people,

administer the Sacraments.

    _ 13. Depriving the poor, the miserable, and
the sick, of their Almes.

you, and obtain pardon for all your sins.

Kindred.

    _ 19. Receiving Goods from Robbers on the
High-wayes, Extortioners, sacrilegious
persons, &c.

    _ 21. Passing this tranfitory life in Society, and
at last falling together into Damnation.

    _ 22. Having the World at will.

towards them, and having by experience
found them seducers, cheats and impostors,
will hold their hands from further Gifts;

will cry out, &c. Remember you never did
good.
